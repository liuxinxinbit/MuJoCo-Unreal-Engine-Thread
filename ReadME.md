# MuJoCo Unreal Engine Plugin

This plugin integrates MuJoCo physics engine with Unreal Engine, allowing you to load MuJoCo XML files directly into Unreal Engine and run advanced physics simulations.

## Update Features

- Added support for 500 hz mujoco simulation
- Optimized DLL dependencies for easier integration and reduced setup complexity

## Features

- Load MuJoCo XML files into Unreal Engine
- Run MuJoCo simulations and display results in real-time
- Support for procedural mesh generation for non-primitive MuJoCo shapes
- Import object colors from MuJoCo models
- Multiple simultaneous simulation instances support

## Installation

1. Clone this repository to your Unreal Engine project's `Plugins` folder
2. Rebuild your project
3. Enable the MuJoCo plugin in your project settings

## Usage

### Basic Setup

1. Place a `MuJoCoSimulation` actor in your level
2. Set the XML file path in the actor's properties
3. Start play mode to see the simulation

### Controls

- **Z key**: Hold to run simulation, release to pause
- **R key**: Reset simulation to initial state
- **C key**: Test MuJoCo actuators control (sets Actuator 0 to a small value, useful for testing models like car.xml)

## Current Limitations

- Texture support is not yet implemented (only colors are imported)
- It is still rough and not optimized for performance
